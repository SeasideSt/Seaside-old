handles: aStringOrObject
	"If specified as a string, should be a comma-split list of any of the following: 'n, e, s, w, ne, se, sw, nw, all'. The necessary handles will be auto-generated by the plugin. If specified as an object, the following keys are supported: { n, e, s, w, ne, se, sw, nw }. The value of any specified should be a jQuery selector matching the child element of the resizable to use as that handle. If the handle is not a child of the resizable, you can pass in the DOMElement or a valid jQuery object directly."
