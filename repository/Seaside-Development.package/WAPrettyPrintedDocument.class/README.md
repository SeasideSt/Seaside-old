This Document can be used in place of a WAHtmlDocument and will display a pretty version of the HTML source that would have been generated by the WAHtmlDocument.

The technique here is that:
 - anything we are asked to output raw (i.e. #nextPut: and #nextPutAll:) we encode with entities
 - anything we are asked to entity encode (i.e. via #xmlEncoder) we double-encode, by wrapping the two WAXmlEncoders around each other
 - anything we want to output ourselves (i.e. prettiness) we do using a WAHtmlCanvas that we create ourselves
