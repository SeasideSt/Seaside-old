style
	"Returns a CSS stylesheet associated with this component. This stylesheet will be added to <head> section of the html document so it will be global and not scoped.

	This is done for all visible components (see class comment of WAComponent for what visible means).

	Nice for demos but consider using WAFileLibrary or external files instead."
