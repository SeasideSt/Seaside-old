hooks
initialRequest: aRequest
	"When a new session is started, all visible presenters (components or tasks) receive this message with the request as argument.

	A common usage for this is to initialize their state depending on the URL of the request. This is one building block for bookmarkable URL. The other is updateUrl: where you can manipulate the anchor urls generated by Seaside.

	You can not use #call: in here. Consider using a WATask instead and sending #call: in #go.

	See WABrowser for examples.
	You may want to access the WAPathConsumer (self requestContext consumer) to get a hold of the unconsumed path."
