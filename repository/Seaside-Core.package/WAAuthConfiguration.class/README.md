WAAuthConfiguration defines attributes to store a username and password for an application. It is used by WAApplication to provide a basic single-account authentication mechanism for applications like the Seaside Configuration application. It changes to mainClass for the session to WAAuthMain, which adds a Decoration to check for authentication before displaying the root component.

You can implement your own authentication mechanism without using this configuration by subclassing WAApplication and implementing #verifyPassword:forUser: to lookup account details from a database or similar. You can then manually set WAAuthMain as your main class.
