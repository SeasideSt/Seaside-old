callbacks
callback: aBlock
	"Compared to other form elements this input element is disabled then the callback will still be evaluted but with an argument that is false. So either don't assign a callback to disabled checkboxes or make the callback code aware that he might be invoked in a disabled state.
	
	However if you enable a disabled checkbox with JavaScript then the callback is invoked with the correct argument.
