The OPTGROUP element allows authors to group choices logically. This is particularly helpful when the user must choose from a long list of options; groups of related choices are easier to grasp and remember than a single long list of options.

It has crappy browser support and noone as ever used it. See WAInputTest >> #renderOptionGroupOn: for examples.
